# Agent Setup Overview

Obsidian Harness supports multiple AI agents through the [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol). This section covers how to set up each supported agent.

## Supported Agents

| Agent | Provider | Package |
|-------|----------|---------|
| [Claude Code](./claude-code) | Anthropic | `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp` |
| [Codex](./codex) | OpenAI | `@zed-industries/codex-acp` |
| [Gemini CLI](./gemini-cli) | Google | `@google/gemini-cli` |
| [Custom Agents](./custom-agents) | Various | Any ACP-compatible agent |

## Common Setup Steps

All agents follow a similar setup pattern:

1. **Install the agent package** via npm
2. **Set up authentication** (API key or account login)

The plugin resolves bare command names through your login shell's PATH, so path configuration is often not needed. If the agent is not found automatically, use `which` (macOS/Linux) or `where.exe` (Windows) to find the path and configure it in Settings → Obsidian Harness.

## WSL Mode (Windows)

For Windows users, we recommend using **WSL Mode** for better compatibility:

1. Install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
2. Install Node.js and agents inside WSL
3. Enable **WSL Mode** in Settings → Obsidian Harness
4. Use Linux-style paths (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/node`)

## Switching Agents

Once you have multiple agents configured, you can switch between them using the **⋮** menu in the chat header. To change the default agent for new chat views, go to **Settings → Obsidian Harness → Default agent**.
