## Overview

Obsidian Harness supports opening multiple sessions at once — each an independent `.session` workspace (or legacy chat view) with its own:
- Independent agent process
- Separate session and message history
- Individual agent selection

::: tip
This is useful when you want to work with different agents side-by-side, or run parallel conversations for different tasks.

## Opening Multiple Views

### Via Command Palette

1. Open command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + P`)
2. Search for **"Open new chat view"**
3. A new chat view opens in your configured location

### Via Header Menu

1. Click the **⋮** (ellipsis) menu in the chat header
2. Select **"Open new view"**

## Chat View Location

Configure where new chat views open in **Settings → Obsidian Harness → Display → Chat view location**:

| Location | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Right pane (tabs)** (default) | Opens in the right sidebar |
| **Editor area (tabs)** | Opens as a tab in the editor area |
| **Editor area (split)** | Opens in a new split pane |

## Broadcast Commands

Control multiple chat views at once from the command palette:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Broadcast prompt** | Copy the active view's input text and images to all other views |
| **Broadcast send** | Send messages in all views simultaneously |
| **Broadcast cancel** | Cancel ongoing operations in all views |

::: tip
Broadcast commands are useful for comparing how different agents respond to the same prompt.

## Focus Navigation

Quickly switch between chat views:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Focus next chat view** | Move focus to the next chat view |
| **Focus previous chat view** | Move focus to the previous chat view |

::: tip
Assign keyboard shortcuts to these commands in **Settings → Hotkeys** for faster navigation.
