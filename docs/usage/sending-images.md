# Sending Images and Files

Attach images and files to your messages to provide context to the AI agent.

## Attaching Files

### Drag and Drop

1. Drag files from Finder/Explorer onto the input area
2. The input area highlights when you drag over it
3. Thumbnails (images) or file icons (other files) appear below the text area

### Paste from Clipboard

1. Copy a file or image to your clipboard
2. Focus the input field
3. Paste with `Cmd/Ctrl + V`

</p>

::: tip
Embedding images in messages requires agent support. If the agent doesn't support images, image files are sent as file references instead (via drag and drop or paste from Finder/Explorer).

## Managing Attachments

Attached files appear as thumbnails or file icons below the text area.
