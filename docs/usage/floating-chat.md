A persistent, draggable chat window that floats over your workspace. Perfect for quick conversations without leaving your current view.

## Overview

The Floating Chat provides a lightweight alternative to the sidebar chat view:

- **Draggable window** — move it anywhere on screen
- **Resizable** — drag the edges to adjust size
- **Collapsible** — hide the window without losing your session
- **Multi-window** — open multiple floating windows simultaneously
- **Independent sessions** — each window runs its own agent session

::: tip
Enable the floating chat in **Settings → Obsidian Harness → Floating chat → Enable floating chat**.
:::

## Getting Started

1. Enable **Enable floating chat** in settings
2. A floating button appears in the bottom-right corner
3. Click the button to open a chat window
4. Start chatting — the window works just like the sidebar chat

</p>

## Moving and Resizing

- **Drag** the header bar to move the window
- **Resize** by dragging the bottom-right corner of the window
- Position and size are saved automatically

## Multiple Windows

Open more than one floating chat window to run parallel conversations.

### Opening Additional Windows

- Click **"Open new view"** from the **⋮** (More) menu in the floating window header
- Or use the command **"Open new floating chat view"** from the command palette

### Switching Between Windows

When multiple windows exist, clicking the floating button shows an instance menu:
